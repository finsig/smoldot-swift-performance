## Smoldot Swift Performance

An app project for use in conjunction with the XCode Memory Report and/or Instruments.

* Add single chain - client idle.
* Add chain to client, remove chain from client.
* Receive subscription responses.

**Notes**

The [Smoldot Swift example](https://github.com/finsig/smoldot-swift-example) app receives JSON-RPC 2.0 responses to an unbounded array. The above scenarios were used to better understand memory usage independent of the array.
